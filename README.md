# Income-Health-Analysis
Description:

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the relationship between income levels and health outcomes. Using data from various sources, including government statistics and health reports, the study explores how income influences access to healthcare, prevalence of chronic diseases, and health-related behaviors such as nutrition and physical activity. The project employs Python and Pandas for data cleaning and analysis, with visualizations created to highlight significant correlations and patterns. The insights aim to inform health policies and improve resource allocation to support vulnerable populations.
